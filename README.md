# basic_module

This repository is used to maintain some basic python modules that I have made for daily usage. Currently I am working on python 2.7 and will upgrade to python 3 soon.

There are four kinds of modules, targetting on different functionality:
1) zyz_core
2) zyz_data
3) zyz_plot
4) zyz_stat
